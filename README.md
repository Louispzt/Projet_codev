# [Projet CODEV](https://github.com/Louispzt/Projet_codev)

In 2021, the environment is the 4th concern of the French. For example, electrical energy alone represents 41% of CO2 emissions worldwide (9% in France). Vital for the whole population of the population, energy is obtained and produced in different ways across the globe.

The consumption of the French, as well as the production of this energy produces a very large amount of raw data that can be raw data that can be found and/or consumed (OpenData) on the Internet.

However, without processing and personalized display, this data has little value. In order increase its value and bring the information it carries to the French citizen, propose a solution that recovers, transforms and displays it in real time.
